## 🧠 Overview

The **AI Calling Agent** is a Python-based automation tool designed to simulate a voice calling assistant.  
It reads phone numbers from a CSV file, places calls automatically using Twilio’s **Programmable Voice API**, records each call, and generates text transcripts from the audio files.

This project demonstrates the integration of **Python**, **Twilio Voice API**, and **Speech-to-Text** systems (like Whisper or SpeechRecognition).
